Project Overview
This repository contains three scripts solving distinct tasks:

Role Line Extractor - Extracts dialogue lines associated with specific roles from a given text, structured from a classic Russian play excerpt.
Spiral Matrix Generator - Generates a matrix filled in a spiral order based on the given width and height.
Product Review Extractor - Parses product data and displays reviews, prices, and product names from a sample e-commerce data structure.
Files Description:
